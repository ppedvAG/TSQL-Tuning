## What Is This Stuff?

Hi! You've just downloaded a bunch of free stuff that we hope you find useful.
It's our scripts, setup checklists, e-books, and posters about Microsoft SQL
Server. We built this stuff because we needed it too - we're Brent Ozar
Unlimited, a boutique consulting firm that focuses on making SQL Server faster
and more reliable.

The posters and books are pretty self-explanatory. The scripts are:

sp_Blitz - "Somebody just handed me a SQL Server. Is it in good shape?" Instructions: https://www.BrentOzar.com/blitz/

sp_BlitzFirst - "Why is my SQL Server slow right now?" Instructions: https://www.BrentOzar.com/askbrent/

sp_BlitzCache - "What are the most resource-intensive queries on this server?" Instructions: https://www.BrentOzar.com/blitzcache/
